**Author / Verification:** 23f1000470@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Dataset
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Growth - 2024 Quarterly Data:
- Q1: 1.88
- Q2: 8.47
- Q3: 12.31
- Q4: 10.84

**Average:** 8.38

**Industry Target:** 15.0

---

## Key Findings
1. **Average monthly recurring revenue (MRR) growth for 2024 is 8.38%.**
2. **This is 6.62 percentage points below the industry benchmark of 15%**, indicating slower growth.
3. Growth improved from Q1 (1.88%) to Q3 (12.31%) but then dipped slightly in Q4 (10.84%), showing non-stable momentum.
4. The current trajectory is **insufficient** to meet the target without strategic intervention.

## Business Implications
- Slower MRR growth threatens planned FY budgets and reduces runway for product investment.
- If not addressed, investor sentiment and valuation may be negatively affected.
- The gap indicates either a product-market fit gap in existing segments or insufficient penetration/monetization in high-opportunity segments.

## Recommended Strategic Plan — "Expand into New Market Segments"
To reach the 15% target, we recommend a focused market expansion program with the following pillars:

1. **Target High-Value Segments**
   - Identify industry verticals where ARR expansion is highest (e.g., fintech mid-market, healthcare SaaS, e-commerce platform integrations).
   - Run a rapid market attractiveness assessment (TAM, growth rate, willingness to pay).

2. **Map Product-Market Fit Gaps**
   - For prioritized segments, run 6–8 week discovery sprints to adapt product messaging and top 2–3 features.
   - Offer tailored onboarding for segment-specific workflows to improve conversion and retention.

3. **Pricing & Packaging**
   - Introduce value-based packaging (tiered pricing aligned to segment value).
   - Test premium add-ons and seat-based pricing for mid-market customers.

4. **Go-to-Market (GTM)**
   - Dedicated GTM teams for 2–3 prioritized segments (sales + solutions engineering).
   - Use channel partners and integrations to accelerate access.

5. **Demand Generation**
   - Segment-specific marketing campaigns (case studies, webinars, targeted ABM).
   - Increase outbound SDR efforts into target accounts identified by ICP.

6. **Customer Success & Expansion**
   - Proactive expansion playbooks (QBRs, usage-based triggers) to increase expansion MRR.
   - Fast-track churn prevention for high-risk cohorts.

7. **Measure & Iterate**
   - Set monthly KPIs: new MRR from targeted segments, conversion rate, expansion MRR, churn.
   - Run 90-day OKR cycles and prioritize high-leverage experiments with clear success metrics.

## Visualizations & Code
- The repository includes:
  - `analysis.py` — code to compute metrics and generate the trend chart.
  - `mrr_trend.png` — saved chart illustrating quarterly MRR growth and benchmark.
  - `mrr_report.html` — self-contained HTML report with chart and data.

## How this helps achieve 15%
- Focusing on higher willingness-to-pay segments and improving monetization will increase new MRR and expansion MRR.
- With a disciplined GTM + pricing + CS playbook, the company can realistically close most of the ~6.6pp gap in 3–6 quarters by:
  - Accelerating new signups in growth segments,
  - Improving per-customer ARPA through packaging and add-ons,
  - Increasing expansion rate within existing customer base.
